### Research Question:

What is the trend of AI patents worldwide? Which countries are creating the most per capita and what is the trend of those specific countries?

### Data Set:

This data set is retrieved from [ourworldindata.org](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/artificial-intelligence-patents-submitted-per-million). The data set originally consists of 4 columns:  
  
1) Entity eg. Australia  
  
2) Code eg. AUS  
  
3) Year eg. 2015  
  
4) Patents per million (from here known as ppm)

The data is transformed by pivoting the table so that it has 4 columns:

1) Country 
  
2) Patents in 2010
  
3) Patents in 2015
  
4) Patents in 2020

The variables found within are numerical ppm. These are rounded to 3 decimal places for readability purposes.

```{r}
ai_data <- read.csv("Data/ai_numbers.csv", check.names = FALSE)
ai_data$`2010` <- round(ai_data$`2010`, 2)
ai_data$`2015` <- round(ai_data$`2015`, 2)
ai_data$`2020` <- round(ai_data$`2020`, 2)

kable(ai_data)
```

  
### Data set description:

``` {r, echo=FALSE}
paste("The dataset contains", ncol(ai_data), "variables and", nrow(ai_data), "observations.")

```
